                "The values I find in you and what you hold dear: Friendship, honesty, transparency, intellect, empathy and a understanding and appreciation of nature. You are a very warm person and you appreciate it when the warmth is reciprocated. There is a sense of truth in who you are and what you do. You won’t do something for the sake of it nor will you do something that you don’t feel comfortable with. It must resonate with your core. You observe and mull before you become friends with someone, as you value meaningful friendships. There is a sense of caution and reservation. But, when you decide to partake in this relationship with a person (eg. friend) then you give it your all. You appreciate intellect and substance in people, conversations and thoughts. Your strength is your transparency. What you see is what you get when it comes to you. No heirs or ambiguity. Your truth is a strength. I think that is a really quality about you and you can’t go wrong with that.You have a way with words to get your intention across in a tasteful manner. You will be direct without being hurtful. You tailor your conversation to the person. You have a yearning to learn about so many things. That interest to learn and acquire new knowledge is a strength of yours.
