                <span><h2>Emotional Intelligence and IQ.</h2><br>
                <p>I really enjoyed the research part iunder sprint 3-core. The research on the above topic could not have happened in a better timing. I revisited  facts I knew but I also deepened my prior understanding as well as discovered new facts which I will be sharing with you in this blog today.<br>Lets’ start from the beginning, shall we?</p><br>
                <p><em><u>1. What is Emotional Intelligence?</u></em></p>
                <p>Many definititions can be found online, and they all point out the same things. That Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the ability to identify, use, understand, and manage emotions in positive ways in order to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathise with others, overcome challenges, and defuse conflict.<br>In other words emotional intelligence can definitely impact the many different aspects of our daily lives, starting from the way we behave and the way we interact with others.
                <p><br>
                <p><em><u>2. How is EQ different to IQ?</u></em></p>
                <p>Intelligence quotient or IQ, is a number derived from a standardized intelligence test. On the original IQ tests, scores are calculated by dividing the individual's mental age by his or her chronological age and then multiplying that number by 100.<br>IQ represents abilities such as:
                </p><br>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visual and spatial processing</strong></li><br>
                    <li><Strong>Knowledge of the world</Strong></li><br>
                    <li><strong>Fluid reasoning</strong></li><br>
                    <li><strong>Working memory and short-term memory</strong></li><br>
                    <li><strong>Quantitative reasoning</strong></li><br>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Whereas Emotional Intelligence EQ, on the other hand, is a measure of a person's level of emotional intelligence. IT refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.</p>
                <p>EQ is centered on abilities such as:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identifying emotions</li><br></strong>
                        <li><strong>Evaluating how others feel</strong></li><br>
                        <li><strong>Controlling one's own emotions</strong></li><br>
                        <li><strong>how others feel</strong> </li><br>
                        <li><strong>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</strong></li><br>
                        <li><strong>Relating to others</strong></li><br>
                        <li><strong>One's level of empathy</strong></li><br>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                <p><em><u>3. How does Emotional Intelligence looks like? </u></em></p>
                <p>A person with a high emotional intelligence has the ability to identify and recognise their own emotional state as well as the emotional states of other beings around them. They also engage with others in a way where others feel drawn to go towards them. They use their understanding of emotions in order to relate better to other people, and in doing so, they have the ability to create healthy relationships with beings in their daily life. It also impacts on their ability in achieving a greater success at work. In brief, a person with a high EQ or EI leads, being always as their optimal level, lives a more fulfilling life.In my research on the subject, I was surprised to learn that Emotional intelligence consists of four key attributes, which I will now be sharing with you.</p><br>
                <p><strong>1. Self-awareness </strong></p>
                <p>Which guides us in being able to identify and recognise our very own emotions. I can also help us in going one step deeper where with self-awareness, we are able to notice as well how these emotions we feel can affect our thoughts and  of course, in a domino effect, our behaviour. It also helps us in noticing and accepting our strengths and limitations, without having any change to our level of self-confidence.</p><br>
                <p><strong>2. Self-management </strong></p>
                <p>It brings me back to my experience in Early childhood, where we would plan strategies to help and support tamariki in regulating their emotions and responses to them. Self-management is in other words emotional regulation where we are able to control these impulsive feelings and behaviours that do pop out from time to time, and sometimes when we expect it the least. This attribute of emotional intellingence helps us in  managing our emotions in a healther way. It also enoucourages us in being proactive and in taking initiative, following through with our numerous commitments, and lastly, it is seen in the ability to adapt to change.</p><br>
                <p><strong>3. Social awareness</strong></p>
                <p>With this awareness, we are able to understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of people around us in our daily routine. We are also able to pick up on emotional cues. We feel comfortable socially, and we can easily recognise and identify the different dynamics existing within a team, a group of people or an  organisation.</p><br>
                <p><strong>4. Relationship management </strong></p>
                <p>We are able to create and maintain genuine relationships, where we showcase clear communication, we can even inspire and influence others around us. We often can be seen as a team-player, and we show great skills in regards to conflict-management.</p><br>
                <p><em><u>4. In which instances do I need to manage my Emotional Intelligence?</u></em></p>
                <p>In life of course, many things are unpredictable and many a times,when we encounter certain situations, we do react rather than pause reconnect to our growth mindset and respond. Some of these tricky situations where the ability to “self-manage” our emotions kind of goes pass us and through the window are:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>when we are giving and receiving feedback.</li><br></strong>
                        <li><strong>when we need to meet a tight deadline.</strong></li><br>
                        <li><strong>when we are dealing with a challenging relationship.</strong></li><br>
                        <li><strong>when we do not have enough resources.</strong> </li><br>
                        <li><strong>when we have to deal with change.</strong></li><br>
                        <li><strong>when we have a setback or do not succeed at something.</strong></li><br>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Among many others.</p><br>
                    <p><em><u>5. How can I get better and have a better level of Emotional Intelligence?</u></em></p>
                    <p>Fortunately, a lot of studies have shown that EQ can be learned and developed. Her are three simple strategies one can use, to develop the right habits in this regard:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Attention training </strong></p>
                    <p>Through this training, we develop the ability of paying attention to what is happening in our body, which then leads us to understand our emotions, how we feel like this and why. As this technique is practiced,we can train our attention in paying a close awareness to our mind, our body and of course our emotions. The attention training nurtures us in developing the skills needed to reach a clear, calm and alert mind.</p><br>
                    <p><strong>2. Self knowledge and Mastery</strong></p>
                    <p>Developing an attentive mind, we are then able to see what is really going on on an internal level. Going back to this level, we are able to develop a clearer knowledge of who we are, how we are and how we engage and respond to different types of situations. And from developing this knowledg, we move towards mastery. Our awareness of how we feel and respond in specific situations also brings along the possibility of auto-regulation.</p><br>
                    <p><strong>3. Creating Useful Mental Habits </strong></p>
                    <p>Re-wiring our brains with positive stories and thoughts for ourselves and others. Instead of saying “I did not succeed, I am a total failure”, train your thoughts in saying “You are on the right path, continue your efforts, you will eventually are doing great”</p><br>
                    <p><em><u>6.Why is EQ important?</u></em></p>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence brings along a lot of benefits starting with the our own personal well-being. However, going one step deeper in my online research and as EDA mentions in its core content for this week. The main three benefits of EQ are:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Stellar Performance</strong></p>
                    <p>As per studies, EQ has substantial impact (Twice as much impact as IQ)in one’s work environment and based on research , EQ is what differentiates average performers from Top ones.What does Stellar Performance look like in the tech world?/p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Achievement drive and standards</li><br></strong>
                                <li><strong>Influence</strong></li><br>
                                <li><strong>Conceptual Thinking</strong></li><br>
                                <li><strong>Analytical Ability</strong></li><br>
                                <li><strong>Initiative</strong></li><br>
                                <li><strong>Self-Confidence</strong></li><br>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                    <p><strong>2. Outstanding Leadership</strong></p>
                    <p>When reaching up to higher levels, EQ is really the key element . It is what makes a leader with good skills, great!</p><br>
                    <p><strong>3. Happiness</strong></p>
                    <p>Last but not least, EQ contributes to happiness. Here, I would like to talk about the growth –mindset which is one sign of high EQ. By developing a growth mindset, you develop a way to be less judgemental to you and others and also not stuck on unchangeable ideas. Working towards developing a growth –mindset would help one in having a better control on the flow of their thoughts and the kind of stories we tell ourselves about us and about others.</p><br>
                    <p>In conslusion, personally, I feel that unlike IQ, EQ ; Emotional intelligence has an important impact on every aspect of our life.It impacts on our performance at work, on our physical health, our mental health and as a ripple effect on ou relationships. Becoming more aware of where we stand in terms of EQ with an open mind (growth mindset) will help us in growing and becoming better versions of ourselves.And in order to grow our EQ, we must start by stopping telling ourselves negative stories like (If I cannot do it, it means I am stupid and a fail) to positive stories ex “In regards to this task, I am still in the “not yet” zone, I will look at the situation from a different perspective, work on my planning and double my efforts. I am on the right track!”. </p><br>
                    <p>Prior to today, I thought I was well –acquainted with EI, but I realised I understimated its benefits and I realised that I should reflect on strategies I could use for myself as IU start a new journey in this career change. The research and the writing process of this blog article, really helped in having a 360 view of Emotional intelligence and an understanding of its importance in the tech world. I will be definitely working on using strategies to develop further a my Emotional intelligence.</p><br>
