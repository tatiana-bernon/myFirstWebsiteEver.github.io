            <h2>Reflection on my learning journey so far and planning ahead of Bootcamp.</h2>
                
            <p>
                <em><u>1. What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</u></em>
            </p><br>

            <p>
                (i) I thought that with my previous job experiences and leadership opportunities, I had developed a wide range of soft skills at quite a deep level. However, through the challenges of foundations, I quickly realised that, I was not correct in assuming that in regards to Core, I would be resting on my laurels. Soft skills is not only a matter of exploring it in at a deeper level. It is also about taking distance, finding new perspectives to reflect from and getting out as often as possible from my comfort zone. Things I had been too comfortable to do or even realise for quite a while now. Well, now I know.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                (ii) My willingness and abilities in asking for help. I have always been the person we come to for advise, help and support. And once again, as mentioned before, it something I simply did not value to grow and develop, also because I would hate to bother or disrupt others routine. I have always been perseverent, with a good amount of strong determination, willingness to achieve and even stubborness, most of the time when stuck, I would just go on until I have a break through. With this new career change, well, I cannot go about that easy and though was hard to start asking for help, I reflected a lot about why it was so hard, and realised that in the end if I just continue not asking for help, I am just sabotaging myself. So I strarted approaching my facilitator for help more oftern and slowly approached some of my cohort peers as well. I  feel grateful for such realisation early in this journey and certain that  in few weeks, I wont have any shame, approaching anyone for some guidance and help. At least that my goal.
            </p><br>
            
            <p>
                (iii) Well neuroplasticity and growth mindset, made me realise how harsh I am to myself and how it unhealthy in the end to just discourage oneself at every moment of doubt or mistake, and by the amount of mistakes I did these past 5 weeks, you canimagine the level of self-criticism. But the thing is, in regards to others, I always cheer people up and bring as much positivity and encouragement I can, and it comes, naturally. Then, how can I be so harsh to myself?! So  once more,  it is good to realise it that early, and slowly handle it with different strategies.
            </p><br>
            
            <p>
                <em><u>2. What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</u></em>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                I feel that it is at the centre of collaboration and working as a team, values, empathy and self-awareness are the cement to successful teamwork. I feel it’s the base for smooth interaction but also meaningful growth for each individual member of a team, which makes the team work even more enjoyable, rewarding and empowering.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                Also on a more personal level,  values, empathy and self-awareness give us a holistic way in knowing ourselves better, in terms of the current training we are receiving. And what we want to do once we are ready, the culture we want to be part of and maybe we want to create or contribute to as well as the richness within us that we can bring.

            <p>
                <em><u> 3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</u></em>
            </p>

            <p>
                How the readings and exercises led to a deeper level of reflection on oneself in relation to others. IT really is something I never have experience in any other tertiary education level.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <em><u>4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</u></em>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It was the identity part, definitely. For a long time, I struggles with finding my own identity, it was hard to resume my reflections where I long had left them and equally if not more, to share it in a blog post.But going through made me reconnect with myself in a positive way and sharing it on the blog as well gave to some extent peace and closure. So, yep quite challenging but I cannot wait for more.
            </p><br>
                
            <p>
                <em><u>5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</u></em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Because core skills are sometimes harder to develop than techical skills. And currently the tech field is looking for more dev with such core skills. Core skills are what differentiates a good dev from a great dev.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <em><u>6. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</u></em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Not a waste of time at all, it equiped me with tools to work with others and also to be kinder to myself through this process. I really enjoyed reflecting on a deeper level and growing a bit more my self-awareness
            </p><br>

            <h3>My learning plan: Part 2 - Getting ready for Bootcamp</h3>

            <p>
                <strong> 1. What is your long term goal and or career pathway? </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                I don’t  have a clear plan anymore lol, but I would just want to find a job as a junior developer in a company that would provide me opportunities for me to further develop my skills (technical and soft) Initially that would be just amazing! Once I find my feet in the tech inductry, then I might reflect on where to go and what to do next, merging my experience in education and tech would be something I would be passionate in further exploring as well as Girls in Tech, since though there is progress, I keep hearing from friends in the field that they would love to have more girls/women doing actual programming.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <strong>2. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be? </strong>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                My communication skills, courageous conversations but also finding a balance with work but also looking for my well-being (creating tiny habits) 
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <strong>3. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                My strength: A team player, who would like to learn as much with others through pair programming and also respect others  learning tempo and who loves to help whenerver I can. I also can easily place myself in others shoes.
            </p>

            <p>
                My limitations: I am very hard on myself and place my well-being last at times, avoid delegating if possible as I hate to bother or disrupt others.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                <strong>4. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp? </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                My commitment is very simple : to give my everything, everyday and to  just ask for help to anyone, after having tried hard for a relatively correct duration of time, making sure to use all the problem-solving techniques. To help as much as I can and to find strategies to laugh at  frustration and focus on work instead of pulling myself down. I will also work after hours on things, I did not understand fully or ask to pair program after hours .
