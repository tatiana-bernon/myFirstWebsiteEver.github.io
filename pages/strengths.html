          <p>My strengths?<br> Did I mention that I do not particularly enjoy talking about myself?<br>No, I did not?<br>okay, well, I am telling you then. ha! ha!<br>You know what? I think i'll just pass and go directly to my limitations</p><br>
          <p>In terms of limitations, It is hard for me to disconnect from work, I have the tendancy to place everyone before me and tend to forget myself in the process. I am and overthinker and it can be drainning. When I am not focussed, I tend to do a lot of multi-tasking and nothing good comes out of it, really. Lastly frustration is my kryptonite. Yep, as my friend Clark Kent, long-term exposure is not good for me. </p><br>
          <p>If I really have to share my strengths, I would say I am very patient, I am empathetic and I can easily put myself in one's shoes. I adapt rapidly to change, even though in new situations a tend to be very much of an observor and very quiet at first. I am also flexible and I love solving problems - helping others as much as I can.</p><br>
          <p>We all know that no one is perfect. We are just perfectly imperfect creatures and that's ok. However, personally, I always aim at, having a balance of both.<br> Not an easy task, ey buddy?<br></p>

          <p>Well, we can only keep trying.</p>
