            <p><em><u>1.	What's important to you in life?</u></em></p>
            <p></p>Such a big question, but I would say, being true to oneself and as part of a community to embrace our differences as taonga/treasure and make it our strength.<p><br>
            <p><em><u>2. If you could have any career, without worrying about money or other practical constraints, what would you do?</u></em></p>
            <p>I would be an influencer/photograph/journalist, travelling around the world and sharing my learnings and discoveries with everyone on my personal website, made and maintained by myself.</p><br>
            <p><em><u>3.	When you’re reading news stories, what sort of story or behaviour tends to inspire you?</u></em></p>
            <p>Success stories of amazing humans who succeeded in achieving their personal projects and share the wisdom and learnings that they encourntered through their learning curve/journey. Inspirational and hopeful stories.</p><br>
            <p><strong><u>4.	What type of story or behaviour makes you angry?</u></strong></p>
            <p>Injustices, or stories or humans encouraging violence and negative and toxic behaviors. Also stories which relate more to the superficial rather than the essence of things, of life.</p><br>
            <p><strong><u>5.	What do you want to change about the world or about yourself?</u></strong></p>
            <p>About the world, I wish the world was a safer place in terms of how one can be seen and accepted. A world where differences are valued, warmly welcome and celebrated. One where beauty is a concept so abstract to the human mind that everyone/everything is seen as beauty. This is my utopia but I would like to see a kinder world, with no discrimination, bullying and other toxicities. <br>About me, maybe change and be more assertive and confident towards my choices, and definitely stopping the overthinking about everything, every minute of the day. That would be great!</p><br>
            <p><em><u>6.	What are you most proud of? </u></em></p>
            <p>My determination, ambition and willingness to achieve my personal goals and projects and my ability to recognise and share to whoever is interested my learnings, my mistakes and little wisdom I got from them.<br>My motto: "Where there is a will, there is . . .wait for it. . .ALWAYS a way"</p><br>
            <p><strong><u>7.	When were you the happiest?</u></strong></p>
            <p>“Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.”
              <br>― His Holiness The Dalai Lama -</p><br>
