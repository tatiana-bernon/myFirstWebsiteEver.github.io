                    <p>
                        In my previous career, many a times, I found myself in situations where I had an ethical decision to make. Unfortunately, I could not remember a good and easy example to share. So, I decided to go to my current rubber duck, aka my husband and asked him if he could remember any of my work anecdotes I would share with him that involved a conflict to my personal ethics and morals. Well, to my disbelief (not really)! He could not remember either. So he told me, it’s so easy! Just make one up! I contemplated the idea for five minutes, thinking that in the end it is just a matter of showing our sense of ethics and that’s it. But something within me was like, nah! You cannot do this, this is not genuine you, this would be lying and that’s not fair towards everyone else who will share something real and genuine about their own personal learning and growth in regards to ethics. And that’s when it happened! Light-bulb moment! I realised this was the perfect example. My husband is an under-cover genius!

                    <p>Mauritius, my mother land, is a multicultural country (*whether based on a religion, ancestry or language perspective).<br>And I feel that the very aspect of how, as a nation, we own our roots within our respective communities* and how we also celebrate each others rituals, beliefs and festivities; this transcendental respect towards inclusion, resides in the essence of my values and identity.<br>On the other side, even though Mauritius can be compared to a beautiful rainbow in terms of the richness of its multiculturalism, and though there is inclusion, as the colors of a rainbow do not mix and stay distinct to the eye, Mauritian multiculturalism is one which still has boundaries, where each culture within the island strongly holds on to distinguishing themselves from each other. Unfortunately, silently encouraging labelling and categorising from a skin color perspective, religion perspective, language perspective.  This should explain the statement I made earlier, in my self-introduction on slack , that I always had issues figuring out my identity, as I never fit any label or category.<br>But today, I am at peace with who I am because I realised that by never really belonging anywhere, I belong everywhere at the same time. This life learned lesson, brought me in developing kindness, love and respect as my key values. Being open to know others, other people, other cultures, languages, beliefs, rituals, by living my values, embracing ‘different’, I open more doors on the world and within myself<br>That may sound very complex and abstract and it is! However, that are the only words I could find, for now at least , to be able to  answer this question.

                        I am someone whom you can count on and my positive/can-do attitude is what catalyses my problem-solving skills. I am a team-player who works hard and perseveres in order to achieve the planned result (I do enjoy the journey more than the result though.). I adapt and learn fast and love to share what I get to learn as well as help others.<br>In terms of limitations, it is really hard for me to focus on one task at a time, my brain tricks me to multi-task (professional deformation) which of course leads to frustration when things are not going the way they should. I am a perfectionist and many a time, I get stuck on details, forgetting the big picture and not being able to reach this notion of perfection I set for myself, stresses me out and the stress of course brings my old friend, diffidence, out.

                        I work-hard and like to learn new things and new ways to do things. I enjoy problem-solving and loves finding problems to solve too (could be a limitation as well he! he!) I am good at planning work ahead of me and adapt rapidly to changes. I could venture to say that I am an independent learner, however I do appreciate the fun and beauty behind team work. I find it very rewarding and empowering actually. I am often told that I have an open-mind and understands the power and benefits of feedback and feedforward.<br>I have very high standards for myself and aim at overachieving them a little bit every time. Though I work hard towards it, when it does not happen, I reflect on what did not work out as it should have and learn from it. Growth and learning are really important to me. (I compete with myself ALL THE TIME, and sometimes it can be tiring as with this comes self-awareness and self-criticism.)

                    <p>
                        My positive-attitude, my perseverence and open-mindedness will really help me in growing in this learning journey. Well to be honest, I feel that up to now, I have been my own obstacle. I use mindfulness daily to be kinder to myself.</p><br>

                    <p>
                        In my previous job, I was the superver of two rooms (ECE), I was working closely with two teams of teachers, mentoring and coaching each one of them as per need. Two teachers (one had been there for a long time and another was new and still learning) in a same team had repeated conficts. One day, I went to the teacher who had been there a while now, for a catch-up on things and I could feel a tension, a refusal to let me help her and the team and even received aggressive communication from this teacher, who suddenly was really upset, speaking angrily and loudly at me. I stopped her calmly with a low voice, keeping it all together(trying to) and told her “I can see that you are not in the right frame of mind for such discussion, please, have a break and later we will talk about it” She accepted and later on I did had a triadic with the two teachers as well as two separate meetings where the said teacher apologised and recognised there was no need for her to act out and we worked it out together.<br>Reflecting on it, I should not have approached the teacher while the most recent conflict was still very fresh. I could have waited for things to calm down to come and talk and maybe also avoided to do it in front of everyone. I also might have planned ahead (since changes do bring resistance) , and worked with the team in regards to changes and accepting the new upcoming team dynamics. I also might have looked into the ways I could have empowered the teacher (prone in showing resistance) by delegating some of my work instead and letting her, for example induct and guide the new teacher. “Forshadowing” is also always a good strategy to reflect on. Team collaboration through planning can provide such "forshadowing" of possible situations to encounter and expect, and in each possible scenario what to do. In doing so, it reestablishes a shared amount of control to the team. And if something happens and they did not even expect it, by then their collaboration would have made their bond as a team, grow stronger.
