                    <span><h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration.</h2></span><br>
                    <h3>Part 1: Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3><br>
                    <p><em><u>1. Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</u></em></p>
                    <p>One year ago, at my workplace, we were having a high number of enrollments for the babies room where I used to work as an . As a team of 4 teachers, we were all collaborating towards supporting the infants/babies holistic well-being and easing their settling in the room as well as working closely with their parents and whaanau in this regard.<br>In this stressful period of the year, where 80% of daily attendance were new tamariki, (I let you imagine, a day with 5-6 emotional unsettled babies/young toddlers, yeah, not a piece of cake!) the whole team was in the same boat, helping each other. Except one colleaugue, who had recently resigned and each time the supervisor was off the floor would literally do nothing. [Sorry for the long intro, but you needed context to understand what I did].<br>One morning, 2 weeks before this colleague’s last day. The said colleague, told me “you know what, I am drained from all of this, I have 10 sick leave left, from tomorrow I’ll be calling sick and just netflix all day for a couple of days or more (wink),  so I don’t loose my sick leave prior to my last day.” I could not believe my ears! I was overwhelmed as I had never before been working in settling so many tamariki and families at once and having this person literally switch off from her job 2 weeks prior to leaving and telling me this, completely collided with my sense of ethics in regards to work, but even more in regards to the children under our care and their families, deeply in connection to the very essence of teaching as a vocation.<br>That night, I called my colleague and shared exactly how I felt about the whole rooms’s current “busy/overwhelming/stressful” situation and her not helping when the supervisor would not be around. I also talked about her using her sick leave. We had a conversation around ethics and I shared how I roll. I told her that in the end it was her decision and it was also really important for me to talk to her about it.<br>To my surprise, following this exchange, my colleague did not use any of her sick leaves and collaborated and supported the team until her happy last day.</p><br>
                    <p><em><u>2. Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</u></em></p>
                    <p>Mauritius, my mother land, is a multicultural country (*whether based on a religion, ancestry or language perspective).<br>And I feel that the very aspect of how, as a nation, we own our roots within our respective communities* and how we also celebrate each others rituals, beliefs and festivities; this transcendental respect towards inclusion, resides in the essence of my values and identity.<br>On the other side, even though Mauritius can be compared to a beautiful rainbow in terms of the richness of its multiculturalism, and though there is inclusion, as the colors of a rainbow do not mix and stay distinct to the eye, Mauritian multiculturalism is one which still has boundaries, where each culture within the island strongly holds on to distinguishing themselves from each other. Unfortunately, silently encouraging labelling and categorising from a skin color perspective, religion perspective, language perspective (there are 13 languages used in Mauritius).  This should explain the statement I made earlier, in my self-introduction on slack , that I always had issues figuring out my identity, as I never fit any label or category.<br>But today, I am at peace with who I am because I realised that by never really belonging anywhere, I belong everywhere at the same time. This life learning wisdom, brought me in developing kindness, love and respect as my key values. Being open to know others, other people, other cultures, languages, beliefs, rituals, by living my values, embracing ‘different’, I open more doors on the world and within myself<br>That may sound very complex and abstract and it is! However, that are the only words I can find, for now, to answer this question.</p><br>
                    <p><em><u>3. Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</u></em></p>
                    <p>I am someone whom you can count on and my positive/can-do attitude is what catalyses my problem-solving skills. I am a team-player and who works hard and who perseveres until the planned result is achieved. I adapt and learn fast and love to share what I learn on the way as well as help others.<br>In terms of limitations, it is really hard for me to focus on one task at a time, my brain tricks me in trying to attempt too many things at a time which of course leads to frustration when things are not going the way they should. I am a perfectionist and many a time, I get stuck on details, forgetting the big picture and not being able to reach this notion of perfection I set for myself, stresses me out and the stress of course brings my old friend, diffidence, out.</p><br>
                    <h3>Part 2: Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3><br>
                    <p><em><u>1. Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</u></em></p>
                    <p>I work-hard and like to learn new things and new ways to do things. I enjoy problem-solving and loves finding problems to solve too (could be a limitation as well hehe!) I am good at planning work ahead of me and adapt fast to changes. I am quite an independent learner but I love team work and find it very rewarding and empowering. I am really open-minded and understands the power of feedback and feedforward.<br>I have very high standards for myself and aim at overachieving and though I work hard towards it, when it does not happen, I take it really personally, and will reflect on what is going wrong, it is really important to me to outdo myself, I compete with myself ALL THE TIME, and sometimes it can be tiring as with this comes self-awareness and self-criticism.</p><br>
                    <p><em><u>2. Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</u></em></p>
                    <p>My positive-attitude, my perseverence and open-mindedness will really help me in growing in this learning journey. Well to be honest, I feel that up to now, I have been my own obstacle. I use mindfulness daily to be kinder to myself.</p><br>
                    <p><em><u>3. Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why. </u></em></p>
                    <p>In my previous job as a teacher, supervising two rooms, I was working closely with two teams of teachers, mentoring and coaching eone of them as per need. Two teachers (one had been there for a long time and another was new and still learning) in a same team had repeated conficts. One day, I went to the teacher who had been there a while now, for a catch-up on things and I could feel a tension, a refusal to let me help her and the team and even received aggressive communication for the teacher who suddenly was really upset, speaking angrily and loudly at me. I stopped her calmly with a low voice, keeping it all together and told her “I can see that you are not in the right frame of mind for such discussion, please go have a break and later we will talk about it” She complied and later on I did had a triadic with the two teachers as well as two separate meetings where the said teacher apologised and recognised there was no need for her to act out and we worked it out together.<br>Reflecting on it, I should not have approached the conflict while it was still very recent. I could have waited for things to calm down to come and talk and maybe not in front of everyone. I also might have planned ahead since changes does bring resistance and worked with the team in regards to changes and acceptance to changes. I might have also empowered this teacher by delegating some of my work and let her for example induct and guide the new teacher. “Forshadowing” is also always a good strategy to reflect on, and how planning can provide this forshadowing to a team, and reestablish an equal amount of control towards expected change.</p><br>
