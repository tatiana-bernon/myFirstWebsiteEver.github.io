                <p><em><u>1. What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</u></em></p>
                <p>Well, after the bootcamp, I would love to be able to be employed as a full-stack junior developer and continue building my knowledge and skills. It would be amazing if it could be also linked to education in someway (like working for storypark hehe!) or even teach programming to children during holidays as a side project! On the long term, grow and become a senior developer and maybe on the side develop my own business/product (website or app).</p><br>
                <p><em><u>2. What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</u></em></p>
                <p>Go deeper in terms of strategies in regards to courageous conversations.Something I started to be well acquainted with but would still avoid them if I can. <br> Get better at my communication skills.<br>I have a sound knowledge of soft skills due to my experience in teaching and mentoring teams of teachers. However, I feel being new to the field of technology, things are different. So I feel I would need help in calibrating the skills I have to this new field.<p><br>
                <p><em><u>3. A description of your own strengths and limitations.</u></em></p>
                <p>In terms of human skills, I would say that I am very tuned to others when working as a team. I am respectful and attentive to everyone's pace and respects it, I give as much support as I can in an empowering way, not taking the growth from others. I am a good listener, and with patience and understanding I place myself in others shoes. I am a team player who likes celebrating small wins and believe that working has to be fun otherwise why bother?!<br>In terms of soft skills, I would say, I can be so invested in others that I put their needs first and forget about myself, my tasks and even my own well-being. And I have to work on voicing out when I am out of my depths, and ask for guidance and help, reminding myself that it is ok not to know and to be at the "not yet" stage.</p><br>
                <p><em><u>4. Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</u></em></p>
                <p>During foundation, I will be following the same schedule as bootcamp as much as possible, in terms of timings (8.30-5.30).. I will use toggle and pomodoro timer to track my progress. In terms of productivity this daily routine has been working for me. In terms of safe communication with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives, Well, I feel like I will have to get out of my comfort zone and ask for help when in need. As I told my facilitator recently, for a long while I have been on the top of my game where others would reach out to me for support and help. It is strange for me to be on the other side now. It is not a matter of ego, but more a matter of recreating a habbit and with time, hopefully it will become effortless and natural as I ask for help and guidance when I need it.</p><br>
                <p><em><u>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</u></em></p>
                <p>Of course, I will try firstly to solve it by myself, trying the lists of solutions I have in head, once the list is done, then proceed to Uncle google. Maybe, I would take a break do something else, then try again. If I am still stuck, I would then reach out to the slack channel, if still not there yet, I would ask my facilitator.</p><br>
                <p><em><u>6. A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</u></em></p>
                <p>A shoulder to cry on . . just kidding, I would say firstly guidance, as it is a total new journey, also reassurance that I am on the right path and that what I feel and am doing is what is meant to happen. Also, when I am stuck on technical things I would expect the type of guidance one receives in a flipped classroom. I would expect some visual examples and support if really I tried everything and struggled for a long while and need more than guidance. In brief, I would expect understanding and support when frustrations happen and motivation to overcome them.</p><br>
                <p><em><u>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in. </u></em></p>
                <p>Nothing comes to mind really. I chose the Bootcamp because for now I do not have such commitments.</p><br>
