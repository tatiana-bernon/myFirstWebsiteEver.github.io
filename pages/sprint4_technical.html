                    <p>
                        What was the problem?<br>It was very recently with Manipulating the DOM challenge; Game Board in the DOM. I was stuck on the last part of the challenge where we had to write a piece of code for the Blue, Green, invisible spots to be counted and for the score to be displayed too as they increase.  
                    </p><br>

                        What problem solving techniques did you use?
                    </strong></p>

                    <p>
                        In that case , I got like a brain freeze, I tried to break the instructions to be able to have an indication of the following steps to take.<br>
                        I re-read what I wrote and the instructions quite a few times, but I just could not get anything from it, it was  sudenly too abstract.I started to read the documentation advised to go through in the read.me part and was convincing myself that the answer was in writing a for loop. And then I went to facilitator for help which helped a lot, and in the end the answer was really simple.

                    <p>
                        I felt anxious and stressed, there was this voice telling me:<br><br><img src="../images/evilvoice.gif" alt="evil and angel standing on kronk shoulders talking to him "><br><br>“what you are going to do in the bootcamp, if a little difficulty pushes you off like this”. <br>I felt stuck and frustrated.

                    <p>
                        I learned that I think too much (many times I think the solution should be a complex piece of code that I think 10 steps forward without trying the most obvious piece of code) and I should chill a bit! Also, it is ok not to know and even more ok to reach out for support and help. As a side reflection, next time before reaching out to my facilitator, I could try more solving techniques and also reach out to my peers as well.

                    <p>
                        Up to now, I don’t think I solved anything in an elegant way. However, there was an instance prior to starting foundations. I was helping with some test automation through Cypress. Some part of the test required me to test the acess to the different pages of the website by clicking on the items on the menu/navigation bar. <br> I needed to write a piece of code to activate the click but it would not execute (just for the first item in the nav bar but not the others) and of course the test would not proceed any further.<br> Until, I took some distance from my written pieces of code and focussed on the object to test rather than finding the solution. Taking few steps back, helped in seeing the bigger picture and lead me to a new perspective to the problem. <br>finally, I solved it by wroting a piece of code to enable the test (through clicking) by working through the 'ul' tag (.children())of the navigation bar instead of testing individually, each 'li' html tag of that same unordered list. This hypothesis of a solution when tested, worked, and made the code cleaner and more elegant if you may say.

                    <p>
                        I used all the problem solving techniques except asking for help. My husband was my acting Rubber duck , and I did pester him quite a bit.  I also  did a lot of trial and error using Cypress documentation. Took a break and then reflected that’s when I had the idea to change perspective.

                    <p>I was highly frustrated since in another part of the test this same piece of code was working like a charm. I also was on a kind of adrenaline-rush edgy situation which would turn me into . .</p>

                        That these strategies are really a go to and that determination is the key as long as you are in control of your level of frustration, and does not become a catalyst to negative stories fed by frustration.

                        Lastly, taking a step back, getting more perspective and distance from the problem, helps too in the solving process.
