# My very First Website EVER!

> At EDA, prior to the bootcamp we have 5 weeks of foundation work where we learned the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript while learning about other essential concepts like the DOM for instance and getting to know our core self better.

> So, we had the opportunity to create our own blog/website, where we would use our newly acquired skills and also share wbout our learnining journey both in terms ot the technical and core skills side of things.
